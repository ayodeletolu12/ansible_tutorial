# This will capture the instructions on how to install Ansible

It can be installed in different ways.

I will be installing using the ubuntu package manager

# Install Ansible on my ubuntu Linux
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ansible -y

Now that it is installed.

# Create a directory for your Ansible project and change directroy into it
mkdir ansible_tutorial && cd ansible_tutorial

# Next is to create an Inventory that will capture the IP addresses of all the hostt we want to manage with ansible
nano inventory

# The inventory file opens up and enter the IP Addresses of all the host or servers you want to mange with ansible

Here you can enter the IP addresses of the servers you want to manage with ansible or enter any fully qualified domain name 
E.g 52.151.194.35

# Next is to run the ansible command to ensure that everything is working fine
ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping

# --key-file means that we are given ansible to use the key file we generated in that path ~/.ssh/ansble
# -m the module, we are using ping. there are a lot of modules

This will make a connection with the servers

# Result of the ansible command run
tolulope@tolulope-OMEN-Laptop-15-ek0xxx:~/ansible_tutorial$ ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping
52.151.194.35 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
20.51.192.105 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
 



Create an inventory directory that will contain all the IP addresses of the host we want to manage
